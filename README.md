# Apple (AAPL) Stock Patterns 
This project explores Apple's stock patterns over the last 5 quarters, compares Apple's stock patterns with Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG), and finds the relationship between Apple's stock price and market fear. For this project I used Python and real-time financial data to examine these patterns.

# Key Questions For This Project
- How has Apple's quarterly revenue behaved in the last 4 quarters?
- How does this behavior compare with Microsoft and Google?
- How does "fear vs greed" mentality correlate with Apple's stock price?

# Tools Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- yfinance
